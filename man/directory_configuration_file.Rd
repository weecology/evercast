\item{main}{\code{character} value of the name of the main component of the directory tree. Default value (\code{"."}) puts the forecasting directory in the present locations. Nesting the forecasting directory in a folder can be done by simply adding to the \code{main} input.}

\item{settings}{\code{list} of controls for the directory, with defaults set in \code{\link{directory_settings}} that should generally not need to be altered.}

\item{quiet}{\code{logical} indicator if progress messages should be quieted.}
}

\description{
The directory configuration file is a special file within the forecasting directory setup and has its own set of functions. \cr \cr
             \code{write_directory_config} creates the YAML metadata configuration file. It is (and should only be) called from within \code{\link{setup_dir}}, as it captures information about the compute environment used to instantiate the directory.
