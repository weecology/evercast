\title{Determine a File's Extension or Remove the Extension from the File Path}
\usage{
file_ext(path, sep_char = ".")

path_no_ext(path, sep_char = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{\code{character} value of the file path possibly with an extension.}

\item{sep_char}{\code{character} value of the separator that delineates the extension from the file path. Generally, this will be \code{"."}, but for some API URLs, the extension is actually a query component, so the separator may sometimes need to be \code{"="}.}
}
\value{
\code{character} value of the extension (\code{file_ext}) or the path without the extension (\code{path_no_ext}.
}
\description{
Based on the separating character, \code{file_ext} determines the file extension and \code{path_no_ext} determines the file path without the extension.
}
\examples{
 file_ext("home/folders.with.dots/stuff/ok.csv")
 path_no_ext("home/folders.with.dots/stuff/ok.csv")

}
