# Historic Wading Bird Data (pre-1986)

These data are collected from multiple sources in an attempt to extend the time series. This focuses on max counts, which is as consistent as possible with our current time series, and enables us to extend the time series of ecological [indicators](../Indicators).

### Max Counts pre-1982

* year - 1890 indicates a pre-1890 rough estimate
* region - Loxahatchee NWR, Water Conservation areas 2 and 3, Everglades National Park, or total for all regions
* species - see [species table](../SiteandMethods/species_list.csv)
* count - Max estimate of nesting pairs

### Max Count Totals
Total reported counts, for all species, and for only CERP-focused species and locations.

### Supercolony Threshold
Indicator of years in which White Ibis or Wood Storks exceeded the supercolony threshold. The threshold is 16977 for White Ibis, 1458 for Wood Storks. Data are from Crozier and Gawlik 2003.
