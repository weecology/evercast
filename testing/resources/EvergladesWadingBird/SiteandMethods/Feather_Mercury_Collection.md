# Feather Sampling for Mercury

### Background and Rationale:
Mercury is a heavy metal that has no known biological function in any organism.
It is therefore not a trace element, and a contaminant at any level. Its detrimental
effects on wildlife at high doses have been known for some time (severe neuronal
degeneration, powerful developmental effects) but the effects at low levels are only just
being discovered, particularly in wild populations of fish and birds (reproductive failure,
endocrine disruption, loss of appetite, increased susceptibility to disease, and others).
Under anaerobic conditions prevalent in many wetlands, elemental mercury (the
stuff in thermometers) may be converted to methylmercury as a byproduct of the
metabolism of sulfur-reducing bacteria. Methylmercury is at least ten times more toxic
than elemental mercury, in part because it can cross the blood-brain barrier, and in part
because it is excreted very slowly. Because of the latter property, it also bioaccumulates
very efficiently in wetland food webs.

In most terrestrial and lake systems, mercury eventually accumulates in
sediments where it is largely unavailable to biota. But in shallow wetlands that wet and
dry regularly, mercury in sediments is regularly re-exposed and recycled. So wetlands
like the Everglades are extremely good at keeping mercury available, and keeping it in
its most toxic form.

During the late 1980’s and 1990’s, Everglades biota were extremely
contaminated with mercury, with some of the highest values measured in vertebrates
recorded – this was true for predatory fishes, mammals and wading birds. The
contamination from mercury resulted in direct mortality of some Florida Panthers,
endocrine disruption in birds, and probably reduced fecundity and survival in birds and
fishes. Human consumption advisories were issued for Largemouth Bass and other
predatory freshwater fishes.

The mercury was coming largely from municipal waste incinerators in the urban
areas of Miami and Ft. Lauderdale. Beginning in the early 1990’s, federal legislation
mandated that mercury be taken out of household batteries, a major source of mercury
in municipal waste. Florida (and later federal) legislation also mandated the installation
of scrubbers on municipal waste stacks, further reducing emissions of mercury aerosols
and particulates.

After about a 7-year lag time, mercury concentrations in Everglades biota began
dropping precipitously – a 75% reduction in two years, for example. The existence of the
mercury problem in wildlife, and the massive reduction in contamination, were both the
result of a long-term mercury sampling program in the Everglades for sport fishes and
for wading birds.

Although mercury may have declined for good, there remain good reasons for
continuing to monitor for mercury contamination. First, it’s not clear that mercury will
remain low – in years following droughts, for example, we may expect to see spikes of
mercury that result from re-liberating mercury tied up in sediments. These spikes could
turn out to be a natural experiment that allows further understanding of the effect of
mercury on nest success. Second, other mercury sources could emerge over time –
some of these might be through atmospheric deposition, or other currently unknown
local sources. Keep in mind that none of the mercury contamination or its decline in the
1980’s and 1990’s would have been discovered without fish and bird monitoring.

### Sampling – tissue, age group and species

Nearly all of the mercury in fish is in the methylated form, and consequently the
same is true in birds. Birds are able to excrete methylated mercury primarily through
feathers as they grow, largely because methylmercury has a very strong affinity for
keratinized tissue. So feathers serve as an accurate record of the amount of mercury
circulating in the birds body at the time that the feathers were grown. The
concentrations of methylmercury in feathers are quite large relative to the amounts in
other tissues, and so feathers give a strong and definite signal if mercury is present.
Feathers from adult birds have two problems – we don’t usually know when they
were grown, and we don’t know where they were grown. Thus they could represent
mercury contamination acquired from outside the Everglades. Young birds are an
excellent indicator, however, if feathers are collected while they are growing. We know
from research that not much mercury gets into young from the egg resources, and we
also know that all of the food the chick gets comes from an easily defined area
surrounding the colony. Chicks are also growing feathers at a rapid rate, and are getting
lots more food per body weight than are adults – so they are excellent bioaccumulators,
and excellent bioindicators of mercury in prey items in the surrounding marsh.
As an aside, the chicks are growing so many feathers during the fast growth
period, they are in effect protected from the effects of methylmercury – nearly all gets
excreted into the feathers. It’s when they stop growing feathers and fledge that the
nasty effects of mercury probably come into play.

We sample feathers from Great Egret chicks – these animals feed almost
exclusively on fish, they are relatively high in the trophic web, they nest reliably from
year to year, and typically nest throughout the study area. So we can get good
geographic representation that is reliable from year to year.

Typically, there are large differences in contamination between colonies in
different parts of the Everglades as a result of “hotspots” of mercury contamination.
These differences are probably due to a complicated mix of water and soil chemistry
factors that favor or disfavor the bacteria that methylate (or demethylate) mercury.

### Sampling protocol

#### Safety: 

Make absolutely sure everyone has eye protection and wears it during
the capture attempt. Those with dime store sunglasses should not consider them
adequate protection. They also tend to be taken off in cloudy or closed canopy
environments, so make everyone who doesn’t were prescription glasses to carry and
use safety goggles or something comparable. Take care too if prescription glasses are
small. The bird’s bill can slip under or around them and still reach the eye.

#### Where to sample: 

Aim to sample chicks from 5 – 10 colonies. In the past, we
have usually sampled from Alley North, JW1 (not recently active), L-67 (a.k.a. Horus),
Vacation, Hidden, Tamiami West, Mud Canal, and 3B Mud Canal. Typically, one or more
of these colonies will not be active or accessible in any year, so we may substitute
others. We are now collecting in cooperation with the SFWMD. Check with Ms. Shane
Atkins ( satkins@sfwmd.gov ) before the nesting season begins in earnest.

#### When to sample: 

When chicks are large enough to walk and young enough they
do not walk or fly fast enough to escape you. The older, the better. To gauge this, you
need to know the approximate date of laying eggs or hatching chicks – this should be
done either from aerial surveys or (preferably) from visits on the ground.

#### What to collect: 

Feathers from the scapular region – middle of the back in
between the shoulders. Feathers should be fairly well developed to obtain enough
material – newly erupting ones are not appropriate. If the birds you are sampling are
mostly down, you are way too early. The birds need to be able to stand up on their own,
and probably run from the nest. Feathers should be pulled individually (not in bunches)
with a quick, firm yank in a direction parallel to the angle of insertion in the skin. These
feathers may be well connected to the blood supply, being growing feathers. If a feather
shaft is broken off, it could allow heavy bleeding – make sure the entire feather base
comes out. If it bleeds heavily, try to remove all of the shaft, and damp bleeding with
cotton until it clots. Collect at least five feathers 2 – 3 inches long, and ten if you can get
them.

Be sure to measure the bill length (culmen, tip of bill to beginning of skin on
dorsal surface of bill) for each bird – this gives us a way to correct each sample for age.
We have also been taking weight information, but this may be optional. Check with
SFWMD.

Very often, the birds will regurgitate their most recent meal. This is unavoidable,
and since you cannot stuff it back in, you may as well collect it. Take extra ziplocs, and
label the sample by date, colony, and culmen of the bird that threw it up. Keep boluses
from individuals separate. Place in a cooler on the boat, and in the freezer AS SOON as
you get back home.

What to do with the bird after you’re done: Release it back into the nest or as
close to the nest as is possible. Be sure to get the rest of the crew out of the nest area in
the future direction of travel. Sometimes the juv seems frozen after its release and may

be experiencing some level of stress or injury. In that case, walk slowly up to it and
encourage it to move a foot or two. It’s wise to carry a small first aid kit to treat any
injuries, bird or biologist.

#### Marking and storage: 

Each feather sample should be placed in a marked paper
envelope or ziplock bag. Paper envelopes are preferable because pulpy tissue attached
to the base of the feather will rot and not dry in plastic. However, plastic bags may be
used in the field in wet conditions. If plastic is used, samples MUST be transferred to
paper as soon as you return for the day. Mark each envelope sample individually – never
mix birds. Note the colony, date, culmen, number of chicks in the nest (if available) and
the hatch order of the chick in the nest if known.

#### Sample size in each colony: 

We try to get between 10 and 20 individual birds in each colony. We only sample one chick from each nest, and only the eldest (largest).

How to catch chicks – Chicks may very well be large enough to leave the nest by
walking or climbing at the age you are supposed to be sampling. Often the trick is to
approach the nest from two or more sides simultaneously. Mirror poles help – try to
hook the bird’s leg, or apply pressure on the head or neck (without hurting the bird)
enough to slow the bird down to the point that it can be caught. Speed and agility are
important here, so do those leg stretches and hyperventilating before you get into the
colony. Note that at this stage if the bird leaves its nest it can generally get back in on its
own. So if you chase but cannot catch a bird, don’t fret about its fate too much.
